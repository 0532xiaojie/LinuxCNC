There are 2 configurations in this directory - my simple robot and the 
barretwam robot.  

To change configurations the correct inverse kinematics module must be 
compiled.  See the README in src/emc/kinematics.  The default is the 
simple robot.

The openrave package needs to be installed to display the robot model.  The
latest version will do, but if you want to generate your own ikfast modules
you will need the custom branch that can generate linuxcnc rtai c code.
